### Briefly About Myself: ###

Growing up, I studied in multiple international schools across Asia. This experience has led me to pursue knowledge out of necessity as I struggled to communicate my thoughts and learn foreign languages.

When I was a kid, I used to make websites on WYSIWYG builders. As I entered university, I picked up video editing, filming and 3D motion design. More than a decade later, I have been able to use my unique experiences and grow my hobbies into real jobs. I was able to land SMM and content management jobs in the media industry even though I majored in Chinese translation. 

My passion for learning new languages fuels me to this day. I am now actively pursuing Frontend Development as I am striving to combine my knowledge of 3D motion design with web technologies. 

My goal is to shape visual services for people all over the world as a Frontend Dev.
